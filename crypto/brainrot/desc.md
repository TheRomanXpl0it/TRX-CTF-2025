With the failure of his **composite modulus scheme** and the **Leaking Oracle**, **Decimus Cryptonicus** grew desperate.  

*"They mock my work,"* he muttered in his study, staring at the burning city of Carthage. *"They say my encryptions are flawed. Fine. I shall create something **so cursed, so incomprehensible,** that even the gods will weep!"*  

Thus, he devised his **final creation**:  

*"I shall take the Emperor’s message… and shift each letter by **8000 places in the grand library of Unicode!**"*  

His assistants recoiled in horror.  

*"But, Master… that will transform the message into **pure gibberish!** No one will be able to read it!"*  

*"Exactly,"* Decimus cackled. *"The best encryption is the one **even I cannot decrypt!**"*  

And so, the **Curse of Rot8000** was unleashed. The flag was shattered into **unreadable abominations**, encoded with **UTF-16 sorcery** so vile that even the gods of Olympus **refused to interpret it**.  

But among the **Numerii**, whispers spread.  

*"This is madness,"* one muttered. *"But madness… can be reversed."*  

With **knowledge of character distributions**, they began the **ritual of reversing Rot8000**, peeling away its cursed transformation, letter by letter.  

Decimus had tried to **outsmart the world**, but in his arrogance, he had created something that **could still be undone**.  

His final mistake **had yet to be exploited**…
