The great **Emperor Numerius Augustus** of Rome feared betrayal. His enemies, both within the Senate and beyond the empire’s borders, sought to intercept his messages. If his war plans fell into the wrong hands, Rome itself would crumble.  

To protect his secrets, he summoned **Decimus Cryptonicus**, the empire’s finest mathematician.  

*"I want an encryption system so strong that no barbarian, no senator, not even the gods themselves could break it!"*  

Decimus, known for his **eccentric genius**, devised an **ingenious plan**.  

*"We shall not use two prime numbers for security… but MANY! We will multiply small primes together until we reach an enormous, unbreakable number!"*  

The Emperor was impressed.  

*"And what of the exponent?"*  

*"It shall be vast, My Lord. A prime so large that even the Greek scholars will tremble before its might!"*  

Thus, the Emperor’s messages were encrypted using **countless prime numbers**, forming a **colossal composite modulus**—an encryption **so absurdly large** that **no one** could hope to factor it. Or so they thought.  

Meanwhile, in the shadows of the empire, the **Numerii**, an elite order of cryptanalysts, watched and **laughed**.  

*"This fool has created the most composite modulus in history,"* one whispered. *"It is only a matter of time before we tear it apart."*  

And so, the empire’s **greatest cryptographic mistake** was set into motion.
