The Emperor, still oblivious to the weakness of his previous encryption, demanded a **new, improved method**—one that would withstand even the cunning scholars of Greece.  

*"Decimus Cryptonicus, my most trusted mathematician!"* the Emperor bellowed. *"Give me an encryption that is both strong and efficient!"*  

Decimus, though exhausted, was still determined to prove his worth.  

*"My Lord, instead of many small primes, I shall return to the old ways—**a solid foundation of two strong primes, $p$ and $q$, forming an impenetrable modulus $N$!**"*  

The Senate applauded. The Emperor was pleased. Rome would be secure at last.  

But Decimus was **notorious for overcomplication**.  

*"To ensure the security of $p$ and $q$,"* he muttered to himself, *"I shall add an extra layer of obfuscation. A **leak**, but not just any leak—one so convoluted that no enemy shall understand it!"*  

To the Emperor, it was incomprehensible.  

To the Senate, it was **genius**.  

*"If no one understands it,"* Decimus reasoned, *"surely no one can break it!"*  

For months, the encryption held. The Emperor sent his messages with **unshakable confidence**.  

But in the dark corners of the empire, the **Numerii**, Rome’s secret order of cryptanalysts, examined the leak **closely**.  

*"This is not a safeguard,"* one Numerius whispered. *"It is a gift."*  

*"He has unknowingly encoded information about $p$ and $q$ within the leak itself,"* another said. *"With effort, we can extract them!"*  

And so, the **Numerii** began their work, peeling back the layers of Decimus’s **overcomplicated madness**.  

The walls of Roman cryptography **were crumbling once more.**
